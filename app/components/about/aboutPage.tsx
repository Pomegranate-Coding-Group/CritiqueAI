            The current job market has 11 million job openings and ResumeQuest is here to help college kids land their first job.
            We created this site because we found that a lot of college students have limited experience making resumes and if they
            do have a resume they don't always to what to put on it to make them stand out. At the moment, our website only has data
            for two industries however we will be making our product open source to add any and all fields to our platform. <br /><br />
